# Basic CMake issues task

That's super simple task.
You need to create a super small project and write CMakeLists.txt files for it.

You should have 2 static libraries and 1 exec in your project.
The dir three should be:

```
basics
|
| - lib1 (headers + sources)
| - lib2 (headers + sources)
| - exec (headers + sources)
```

Your project should have install command too.

> Tests are optional
