# Going to details CMake issues task

In this task you should create CMakeLists.txt
that will compile protobuf file and use it in the main.cpp.

Protobuf file and main are provided.

You should use [`protobuf_generate_cpp()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindProtobuf.html).

> If you have some issues with finding Protobuf in CMake
> please find someone who has it working and do this as team.
> Or just skip it =)

> Note: for me (on Fedora) it was enough to install `protobuf-compiler` and `protobuf-devel` packages.
